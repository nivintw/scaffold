"""Ensure files that should stay in sync between the template and this repo's own root do.

copier-everything dogfoods its own template: the repo root is meant to track what a generated
project receives, so a tooling change lands in BOTH places. There is no automated render of the
root (it carries deliberate divergences), so these tests are the guard — they render the
template and compare the output against the repo's own root files.

Every file the render produces (for the shape this repo is) is classified into exactly one of
three buckets, and ``test_every_rendered_file_is_classified`` fails if the render produces a
file in none of them — so a newly added template file that renders into this shape can't
silently fall through the guard (files gated behind other answers — ``src/``, Docker, the
publish workflow — aren't rendered here, and are correctly absent from this repo's root):

- ``TRIVIALLY_EQUAL`` — must be byte-for-byte identical (``test_trivially_equal_files``).
- ``STRUCTURALLY_TESTED`` — legitimately differs; a dedicated test below asserts the rest
  matches after subtracting the documented deviation.
- ``NOT_SYNCED`` — differs substantially by design, or is generated; intentionally not asserted
  (reasons grouped inline below).

copier renders the template's current **working-tree** state (uncommitted changes included; it
emits a DirtyLocalWarning, which the render helper suppresses), and the root side is read off
disk too — so both sides are the working tree and the comparison is self-consistent whether or
not the tree is clean.
